# PizzaRush

Pizza Rush is a mobile (iOS & Android compatible) based application that aims to allow students and teachers to be able to socialize teaching and learning of courses through an enjoyable game.

It provides a platform that allows students to learn and compete with one another through challenging educational content. Teachers will also be able to assess mastery of the course via data analysis and automated grading obtained through the player’s history of accomplishment in the game, in a comprehensive and continuous way.

## Features Overview
<p align="center"><img src="assets/Banner.png" width="200"> </p>
Pizza Rush is designed as a dual user application, with its targeted users being students and teachers. It provides different functionalities to each of its users accordingly, as has been elaborated below. 

### STUDENTS
<b> View Player History </b> 
* The student can view their past performance in each math section in the form of a line chart (Y axis: points, X axis: Time).
* The student can view current point accumulation and upcoming grading deadlines for each math topic.
* The student can view their past grades for each section for each past deadline. 
* The student can access the grading rubric, using which the points to grades conversion is determined. 

<b> Select Math Topic </b>
The student can select the any math section they would like to solve questions from. Currently PizzaRush supports 3 topics (Algebra, Trigonometry and Geometry).

<b> Select Level of Difficulty </b>
The student can solve questions of varying difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) within any chosen math section. The following levels can only be unlocked when played in order: Easy -> Medium -> Hard. 

<b> Buy Hints </b>
While playing the game a student may buy a hint using points, to help solve a particular question. The number of points required to buy a hint is variable, and depends on the points per hints scheme as below. 

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Difficulty Level</th>
    <th>Points Deducted per Hint</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Easy</td>
    <td>-30</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Medium</td>
    <td>-60</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Hard</td>
    <td>-90</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<b> View Leaderboard </b>
The student can view all students enrolled in each Math topic category (Algebra, Trigonometry or Geometry), in descending order based on their points’ scores. The leaderboard is dynamically updated as students progress through the game - by solving questions or buying hints. 

<b> Challenge Friend </b>
The student can challenge another friend in a specific Math topic category (Algebra, Trigonometry or Geometry) at a selected level of difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard). 

### TEACHERS
<b> Add Questions </b>
The teacher can upload questions for the students to solve according to a pre-designed questionnaire template. 

<b> View Course Performance Summary </b>
The teacher can view the summary statistics generated by the application in the specific Math topic categories (Algebra, Trigonometry or Geometry). These will include:
A line chart with the Progression of the Average Score of the class over time
Mean, Median and Standard Deviation of class scores on each assignment, with assignment date

<b> View Leaderboard </b> 
The teachers can view the same leaderboard that is available to the students. 

### COMMON FUNCTIONALITIES 
<b> Authentication </b> 
The Student or Teacher can login to the Pizza Rush Application by entering his/her Username and Password. The user domain(student/teacher) shall be automatically determined upon login, and does not need to be mentioned. 

## Grading System 
* The student shall be graded based on the active involvement in playing the game - which will be quantitatively measured by the points accumulated, individually for each section. 
* There shall be a grading deadline set for each math topic, which is entitely upto the discretion of the teacher. 
* The points accumulated in that math section by that deadline shall determine the grade based on the grading rubric available to the student. 
* The points accumulated in that math section shall be reset to 0 once the deadline has elapsed, and the grade has been decided. After which, a new deadline may be introduced. 
* The deadline shall be renewed regularly at the teacher’s discretion. 

## Solving Questions
* The student is able to select the math topic and difficulty level for which they wants to solve questions for. 
* The difficulty levels must only be accessed sequentially, and are locked from access until a certain point threshold for that section is reached.
* The student will see a story context for the question before the question is displayed, which will introduce the game aspect. 
* There is a story context for each individual question.
* The story context shall consist of a game world and character, which is randomly assigned to a user, and changes with every question. 
* The user must then be directed to the question screen, which consists of a question, 4 answers and a hint option. The question shall build on the sotry context and may be MCQ, interactive numerical or interactival area based. 

The points earned per questions answered by the user shall be determined by the points ruberic below: 
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Difficulty Level</th>
    <th>Points Awarded per Correct Answer</th>
    <th>Points Deducted for using Hint</th>
    <th>Points Deducted for Incorrect Answer</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Easy</td>
    <td>+10</td>
    <td>-30</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Medium</td>
    <td>+20</td>
    <td>-60</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Difficult</td>
    <td>+30</td>
    <td>-90</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Challenging Friends
Sending challenge
●	The student must be able to challenge another user in a specific math section and at a specific difficulty level of his/her choice. 
●	The challenge must consist of five questions. 
●	The five questions must be answered without any hints and with a running timer. 
●	The student must be able to view his/her score and time for the challenge once the challenge is completed. 
●	The student must be able to send the same challenge (same set of five questions) to another user by selecting the user from a drop down menu. 

Accepting challenge 
●	The student must be able to see the challenges received from other users. 
●	The student must be able to choose to accept or decline received challenges. 
●	The student must be presented with the same five questions to solve as those solved by his/her challenger. 
●	The student must be presented with his/her score and time for the accepted challenge.
●	The student’s score must automatically be shared with the challenger. 
●	The student must also be presented with a win/lose message based on the points/time ratio of his/her performance as compared to that of the challenger’s. 
●	The student must be able to further challenge another user if he/she wishes to do so. 

View sent challenges
●	The student must be able to view all previously sent challenges. 
●	The student must be able to view whether or not the challenges have been accepted. 
●	If the challenge has been accepted, the student must be able to see the challenged user’s score and a win/lose message based on the point/time ratio. 

## COURSE PERFORMANCE SUMMARY 
●	The teacher must be able to view the summary statistics for each in the specific Math topic.
●	The course summary statistics shall include:
●	A line chart with the Progression of the Average Score of the class over time for each individual section (Y axis: average points of class, x axis: time) 
●	Mean, Median and Standard Deviation of class scores on each past assignment, with the corresponding assignment date

## ADD QUESTION
●	The teacher must be able to upload questions for the students to solve according to a pre-designed questionnaire template.
●	The questionnaire template shall include the following components:
○	Select math topic - Drop down menu
○	Select difficulty level - Drop down menu
○	Select game world - Drop down menu
○	Select Characters- Drop down menu
○	Write context story - Text box 
○	Write questions - Text box (Option available to add media attachment) 
●	The teacher must be able to upload the drafted question, and must be prompted to confirm before doing so. 

## Usability Requirements 
The system must:
●	Reduce short term memory load: The implementation of navigation bar helps users navigate seamlessly through the features.
●	Permit easy reversal of actions: The user can return to their previous state through the use of a back button.
●	Internal Locus of Control: Defined buttons and titles for each feature of the system help make navigation and task activation clear for users.
●	Strive for consistency: A consistent layout of the features is achieved using similar font, color and search buttons.
