# PizzaRush

Pizza Rush is a mobile (iOS & Android compatible) based application that aims to allow students and teachers to be able to socialize teaching and learning of courses through an enjoyable game.

It provides a platform that allows players to learn and compete with one another through challenging educational content. Teachers will also be able to assess mastery of the course via data analysis and automated grading obtained through the player’s history of accomplishment in the game, in a comprehensive and continuous way.The objective of the game is to help students understand mathematical concepts starting from the basics such as addition, multiplication and division before moving to more advanced concepts like calculus, geometry and percentages.

## Features
Pizza Rush is designed as a dual user application, with its targeted users being students and teachers. It provides different functionalities to each of its users accordingly, as has been elaborated below.

<b> Solve Questions </b>
The student can solve questions according to certain specifications (Topic, Difficulty level). 

<b> Select Math Topic </b>
The student can select the specific Math Topic he/she would like to Solve Questions from, out of the 3 topics we currently have available in our Application (Algebra, Trigonometry and Geometry).

<b> Select Level of Difficulty </b>
The student can select the Level of Difficult (Easy, Medium or Hard), he/she would like the questions to be. The levels can only be unlocked when played in order: Easy -> Medium -> Hard. 

<b> Buy Hints </b>
The student may buy a hint to solve a question using points, according to a points per hints scheme.

<b> View Leaderboard </b>
The student can view all students enrolled in each Math topic category (Algebra, Trigonometry or Geometry), in descending order based on their points’ Score.

<b> Challenge Friend </b>
The student can challenge another friend in a specific Math topic category (Algebra, Trigonometry or Geometry) at a selected Level of Difficulty. 

### TEACHERS
<b> Add Questions </b>
The teacher can upload questions for the students to solve according to a pre-designed questionnaire template. 

<b> View Course Performance Summary </b>
The teacher can view the summary statistics generated by the application in the specific Math topic categories (Algebra, Trigonometry or Geometry). These will include:
A line chart with the Progression of the Average Score of the class over time
Mean, Median and Standard Deviation of class scores on each assignment, with assignment date

<b> View Leaderboard </b> 
The teachers can view the same leaderboard that is available to the students. 

### COMMON FUNCTIONALITIES
